            <p>The school was created on the basis of the guitar store in Samara - Guitar Lavka. Our students always have the opportunity to pick up a high-quality tuned instrument, communicate with musicians, and participate in a jam. The teachers are high-class practicing musicians who can be seen at the city's concert venues. But our school is not limited to guitars and ukuleles. Vocal teachers work with us - not just teachers, but participants in existing musical projects, winners of various competitions.</p>
